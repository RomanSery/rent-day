PROBLEMS
auction doesnt work when the person that lands bids first and doesnt win
can click on roll, refresh page, and click roll again


utilities
you cant mortgage utilities but maybe you can sell them?
- MTA doubles all railroad rent
- con ed utility reduces electricty costs for houses (replace maintance with electricty costs?  every house has electricity costs)

IDEAS
in addition to mortgaging properties, maybe you can sell property at 30% of purchase price
mortgage value should be a % of the purchase price
