maybe small chance of something bad happening when doing train travel
lotto & auction display is broken, cutting off chat window

flash window when its your turn (title alert)

add goTo chance events, take ferry to governors island
turn timer, autction timer, lotto timer
I wish I hade this stuff logged somewhere (in the chat, for example). Like who pays who, who bought which item and who exchanged items and which ones
