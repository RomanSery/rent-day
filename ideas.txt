if timeout 3 times in a row, bankrupt player (add this to help page)
displaying chance event too early, use anaimatio duration to display at the right time
when taking action like roll, complete turn, if err msg comes back like 'not your turn', means UI is out of sync, need to do update_game_state

for some reason cant submit bid of 0?
traveled to wall street, but didnt trigger auction!!
