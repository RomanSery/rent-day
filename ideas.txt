when taking action like roll, complete turn, if err msg comes back like 'not your turn', means UI is out of sync, need to do update_game_state
computer players


share buttons on join game page

when you quit instead of letting game bankrupt you, you are forced out of the game and cant watch.  Add optin to quit, but keep watching.  or quit and leave game


do something for case when its your turn and you have negative $, need to sell something. 
 but when turn over, game automatically makes you lose. instead need to sell a random house if yo have it, or mortgage something

after registering, try to do auto login instead of manual
