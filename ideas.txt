try to make the player pieces stand out more
add more detail to tax/electric tooltips to show how corruption is effectin the values
maybe small chance of something bad happening when doing train travel
show modal when someone goes bankrupt, but its not game over, saying like alex eleminated roman when he landed on blahah


add more chance events

turn timer, autction timer, lotto timer

have to scroll chat window to bottom whe new msg arrives
flash window when its your turn

even on prod, it says connecting to socket twice!

when he bid 0, it showed as if he bid nothing (empty)

browser slows down eventually asks to stop page

msg that says you must build evenly, but still allows building house

when rolling a double and landing on lotto, can roll again without picking

put game length


It's easy to made a connclusion that I won, but there wasn't any specific message with winners name


Once someone chooses “Help” from the main page there’s no button to move back to the main menu
Favicon is still React logo
I wish I hade this stuff logged somewhere (in the chat, for example). Like who pays who, who bought which item and who exchanged items and which ones


Chat history is lost when I refresh the browser
when you have 3 items: 1) build on item 1; 2) build on item 2; 3) build on item 3; 4) build on item 1, you'll receive a warninng message, but the house will be built. It seems to me like building a lot of houses on a single section can make the game unbalanced in such a way that the other players will spend a lot at the early stage of the game if they’re placed at the field which has a lot of houses built fast
